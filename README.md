# My Manual Tester Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a manual tester who has just started my journey in this field. In this repository, you will find documentation regarding the applications I have tested, as well as my experience working with different web applications. Below, I present the projects I have tested as part of my efforts.

With a strong foundation in recruitment, my transition to software testing is fortified by exceptional interpersonal skills, fostering effective communication within cross-functional teams. With a keen eye for detail and an analytical mindset, I excel in identifying and communicating potential software issues, contributing to the overall enhancement of testing processes and software quality. I can handle tasks that require organizational skills well, and I approach new challenges with openness and curiosity.
