# My Manual Tester Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a manual tester who has just started my journey in this field. In this repository, you will find documentation regarding the applications I have tested, as well as my experience working with different web applications. Below, I present the projects I have tested as part of my efforts.

With a strong foundation in recruitment, my transition to software testing is fortified by exceptional interpersonal skills, fostering effective communication within cross-functional teams. With a keen eye for detail and an analytical mindset, I excel in identifying and communicating potential software issues, contributing to the overall enhancement of testing processes and software quality. I can handle tasks that require organizational skills well, and I approach new challenges with openness and curiosity.

### 3. **Scouts-panel (Test app created by a friend)**
   - **Description**: This document is a portfolio focused on testing the functionality, user interface, and user experience of the "Scouts-test.futbolkolektyw" web application. The application is designed for managing and comparing player statistics, including adding players, editing details, creating reports, and managing matches. The document presents detailed test cases simulating potential user actions and reporting bugs in the system.

The tests identified a variety of issues, including improper validation of fields like height, weight, and phone numbers, as well as flaws in navigation and layout consistency. Functional testing was predominantly used, aiming to verify whether specific features worked correctly under predefined conditions. Usability testing was also implied, assessing user interface intuitiveness and interaction design. Each test includes descriptions, expected and actual outcomes, and the status of the issue. Additional observations include suggestions to improve performance, layout, and accessibility, as well as highlighting areas needing clearer workflows and better user guidance.
   - **Types of tests**: functional, usability, accessibility, cross-browser testing
   - **Tools**: Google Docs
   - **Project link**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2Y4ajb68fjjnrV0U2s2Pbs0unIl9-dBhlcY7oliXQE/edit?usp=sharing

### 4. **Basket Buddy (Mobile app for shopping list)**
   - **Description**: The document concerns testing the functionalities of the "Shopping List" module in the "Basket Buddy" mobile application. It contains detailed test cases describing the action steps, expected results, and final outcomes for various scenarios, such as:
Adding products to the list, creating a username, removing products from the list, changing product quantities, adding unit prices, sharing shopping lists, creating and deleting shopping lists, and changing the order of categories.

The document also includes observations about potential issues, such as interface problems in specific sections of the application (eg. problems with displaying the interface for some actions). All tests ended with the status "Passed", which means that the functions worked as required.
   - **Types of tests**: functional, usability, accessibility
   - **Tools**: Google Docs
   - **Project link**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_6-9SIoGgnrI1dOk2ZK7k7HmGFLAoi4hXZl1kui7Z0/edit?usp=sharing

### 5. **skleptest.pl (Website filled with bugs)**
   - **Description**: This document reports bugs and usability issues identified on the website skleptest.pl during testing. It focuses on identifying problems with functionality, layout, and user experience. Key issues include a non-interactive location map, identical URLs for different sections, inability to process PayPal payments, problems with the cart quantity update feature, and invalid data handling in account details, such as allowing numeric values in the "First Name" field.

The testing revealed significant functional and design flaws, such as unresponsive buttons, misaligned elements, inconsistent formatting, and improperly validated input fields. Suggestions for improvement address usability and interface consistency, such as centering elements, ensuring uniform image sizes, correcting alignment of currency symbols, and enhancing user-friendly features like displaying sale prices more intuitively.

The types of tests conducted included functional testing to verify that specific features like adding to the cart or checking out work as expected, and usability testing to assess the website's layout, navigation, and overall user experience. Each issue is detailed with reproduction steps, expected versus actual results, severity, and priority, often accompanied by recommendations for improvement.

### 6. **Merienda (Application to learn Spanish)**
- **Description**: I’ve recently been learning Spanish and exploring various language-learning apps to see which one offers the best results. That’s how I came across Merienda, an application designed specifically for Polish speakers to achieve conversational proficiency in Spanish.


Key features of Merienda include:
- Short, highly focused lessons that take less than 3 minutes.
- A free library of resources, including verb conjugation tables and vocabulary lists.
- Optional paid features like AI chat, unlimited Memo sessions, and grammar tools—all provided for a one-time payment rather than a subscription.
- A Polish-first approach, making it easier to understand grammar and translations compared to alternatives like Duolingo.
Merienda is tailored to help users achieve a B1 level in Spanish within about a year, providing a faster and more comprehensive learning process.

I’ll be conducting functional, usability, accessibility, and cross-browser testing on the app to better understand its strengths and identify areas for improvement. With its focused methodology and Polish-specific design, I’m eager to see how well Merienda supports language learners like me.
